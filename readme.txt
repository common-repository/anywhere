2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to Settings/anywhere to edit your settings.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why create this plugin? =
I created this plugin to allow for easy integration of [@anywhere](http://dev.twitter.com/anywhere/).

= I think i want to uninstall but... =
Be sure to click the uninstall script that you **manually** add a value to `define( 'UNINSTALL_ANYWHERE', '' )` on line 29. That means `1` OR like this: `define( 'UNINSTALL_ANYWHERE', '1' )`. After that run the script and all options should be uninstalled. 
** THIS SCRIPT IS NO LONGER IN PLACE ** *simply uninstall and delete ;)*
